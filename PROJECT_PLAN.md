# Mindful Minutes iOS App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create a native iOS app that mirrors the Mindful Minutes web application, following iOS design guidelines and best practices while maintaining the same design language and functionality.

## Design Language & Style Guide
**Based on Web App Analysis:**
- **Color Palette**: Emerald/teal gradients (#10b981, #14b8a6, #f0fdf4)
- **Typography**: System fonts (SF Pro/SF Compact) - iOS equivalent of Montserrat

- [ ] Haptic feedback for interactions
- [ ] Dynamic Type support
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Accessibility features (VoiceOver, etc.)
- [ ] Widget support (iOS 14+)
- [ ] Shortcuts integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Navigation
